# GraphicTouchTestFT6336U-WT32-SCO1
This is a demonstration how to use the touch function on a WT32-SCO1 display.  
Use is being made of the FT6336U library.  
Video of the demo: https://youtu.be/LmLn20KAmVY.   
TFT_eSPI allows you to change the screen for horizontal or vertical.
The demo must be adapted so that you are reading the correct X and Y values.   
You can do that in the mapping rule.
